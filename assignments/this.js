/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global/Window scope is the window or console object that is "this"
* 2. A function that's called followed by a dot the object before the dot is "this"
* 3. When a constructor function is called the object that is returned is "this"
* 4. When .call() or .apply() is used "this" is explicitly defined 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above

// Principle 1
// code example for Window Binding

// Principle 2
// code example for Implicit Binding

    farewell: 'Good bye',

        console.log(`${this.farewell}, ${name}`);
    }

// Principle 3
// code example for New Binding!

    this.name = gameData.name;
    this.dimensions = gameData.dimensions;      
}
const gameData = {
name: 'Steve',
dimensions: { length: 50, width: 25, height: 65}
}

// Principle 4
// code example for Explicit Bindings
const yourObject = {
    name: 'Steve Barrett',
    city: 'Deland',
    favoriteFood: 'üçï'
  }

  } // The "this" above here is defined on the .call() ^^^ above and is "yourObject"
